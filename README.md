# # Gateways system frontend Instructions

## Previous requirements

 1. Node

## Installing

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Run `npm install` on the root project folder
 5. Run `npm start` on the root project folder

## Considerations

 1. There was not enough time to refactoring
 2. A static paginator could be added to the app
 3. More validations could have been added
 4. Automatic functional tests could have been added
 5. A more elaborate user interface could have been made

## Happy review. Thanks
